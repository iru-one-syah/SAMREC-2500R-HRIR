# HRIR Data

This page aims at making a set of measured HRIR of SAMREC Type 2500R available for download. Our HRIR data were measured in the full azimuth range, 0 to 360, with 5-deg increments, 0 elevations. HRIRs contain binaural cues which are useful for localizing a sound source in the horizontal plane.

### Dummy Head: SAMREC Type 2500R

The photo below shows the dummy head I usually use. HRIR measurements were made the anechoic room in the Department of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering at Kumamoto University - JAPAN.
