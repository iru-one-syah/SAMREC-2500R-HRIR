# HRIR Data

This page aims at making a set of measured HRIR of SAMREC Type 2500R available for download. Our HRIR data were measured in the full azimuth range, 0 to 360, with 5-deg increments, 0 elevations. These HRIRs contain binaural cues which are useful for localizing a sound source in the horizontal plane.
